Getting-Started-With-Django
===========================

Code for the Getting Started With Django series.

The `microblog` branch contains the code for the first two episodes, both dealing with Microblog.
This code should be used as a reference, not as production code. To run the code, you'll need to create
a database, ideally a virtualenv, and install the requirements as laid out in `requirements.txt`.
